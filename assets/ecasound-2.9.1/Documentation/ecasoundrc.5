.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
\fBecasoundrc\fP is the main configuration file for ecasound\&. 
Any user\-specific modification should be done to 
$HOME/\&.ecasound/ecasoundrc, not to the global resource file\&. Ecasound 
also allows one to disable the normal policy and only read from a specific
resource file (see ecasound (1) and documentation for the \fB\-R\fP option)\&.
.PP 
The format is quite simple\&. One line consists of 
a configuration variable and its value\&. Variable and value 
are separated with either \(cq\&=\(cq\& or \(cq\& \(cq\&\&. Lines beginning with a
\(dq\&#\(dq\& are ignored (comment lines)\&. 
.PP 
.SH "VARIABLES"

.PP 
.IP "midi\-device"
MIDI\-device\&. If the device name is given in \fIrawmidi,/dev/midi*\fP 
format, OSS/Linux or OSS/Lite drivers are used\&. 
Device \fIrawmidi,/dev/snd/midiCxDy\fP opens an ALSA raw\-MIDI 
device with card number \(cq\&x\(cq\& and device number \(cq\&y\(cq\&\&. 
See ecasound (1) man page (the \(cq\&\-Md option) for more info\&.
Defaults to \fIrawmidi,/dev/midi\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default\-output"
Output device to use by default\&. If a chainsetup with zero
outputs, but with one or more inputs, is connected, a default output
is added and all the chains are connected to it\&. If the special\-case
value \(cq\&autodetect\(cq\& is specified, ecasound will try to auto\-detect 
a suitable device (JACK \-> ALSA \-> OSS \-> rtnull)\&. 
Defaults to \fIautodetect\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default\-audio\-format"
Default values for sample format, channel count, sampling rate
and channel interleaving\&. Syntax is the same as used by
ecasound\(cq\&s \fI\-f\fP option (see ecasound (1))\&. 
Defaults to \fIs16_le,2,44100,i\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default\-to\-precise\-sample\-rates"
Whether to ignore sample rate differences (and possibly avoid 
resampling)\&. Currently only affects OSS\-devices\&. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default\-mix\-mode"
If \fIdefault\-mix\-mode\fP is \fIsum\fP, engine will mix multiple channels into
one output channel by summing all input channels\&. In mode \fIavg\fP, 
mixing is done by taking the average of all input channels\&. The
\fIavg\fP mode is safe from clipping, while \fIsum\fP is closer
to the way analog mixers work\&. Defaults to \fIavg\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode\-defaults\-nonrt"
Selects the default parameters to use with buffering 
mode \(cq\&nonrt\(cq\& (other modes are \(cq\&rt\(cq\& and \(cq\&rtlowlatency)\&. 
Parameters are given as a comma\-separated tuple of values:
1) buffersize (number,\-b), 2) raised priority (true/false,\-r), 
3) sched_priority (number,\-r:X), 4) double buffering
(true/false,\-z:db), 5) db\-bufsize (number,\-z:db,X), and
6) max intbuf (true/false,\-z:intbuf)\&. Defaults to
\fI1024,false,50,false,100000,true\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode\-defaults\-rt"
See \(cq\&bmode\-defaults\-nonrt\(cq\&\&. Defaults to 
\fI1024,true,50,true,100000,true\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode\-defaults\-rtlowlatency"
See \(cq\&bmode\-defaults\-nonrt\(cq\&\&. Defaults to 
\fI256,true,50,true,100000,false\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource\-directory"
Directory for global ecasound configuration files\&. 
Defaults to \fI{prefix\-dir}/share/ecasound\fP\&.
Note! User\-specific resource files can be be stored 
to \(cq\&$(HOME)/\&.ecasound/\(cq\&\&. For instance you can 
add your own presets definitions to 
\(cq\&$(HOME)/\&.ecasound/effect_presets\(cq\&\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource\-file\-genosc\-envelopes"
Configuration file for generic oscillators\&. Is located in the 
resource directory\&. Defaults to \fIgeneric_oscillators\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource\-file\-effect\-presets"
Configuration file for effect presets\&. Is located in the 
resource directory\&. Defaults to \fIeffect_presets\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ladspa\-plugin\-directory"
Directory containing LADSPA effect plugins\&. Defaults to \fI{prefix\-dir}/lib/ladspa\fP\&.
If environment variable \fILADSPA_PATH\fP exists, directories
specified in it are automatically searched for plugins\&.
Note! To match the syntax of the \fILADSPA_PATH\fP environment 
variable, \(cq\&ladspa\-plugin\-directory\(cq\& can contain multiple
directories, separated by \(cq\&:\(cq\& characters\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-text\-editor"
If \fIext\-cmd\-text\-editor\-use\-getenv\fP is \fIfalse\fP or \(dq\&EDITOR\(dq\& 
is null, value of this field is used\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-text\-editor\-use\-getenv"
Should ecasound try to query environment variable \(dq\&EDITOR\(dq\&\&.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-mp3\-input"
Command for starting mp3 input\&. Ecasound expects to read signed,
16bit, little\-endian stereo audio samples from its standard
input\&. Ecsound will query other audio format parameters by parsing 
the mp3 file header\&. Before execution, %f is replaced with
path to the input mp3\&. If exists, \(dq\&%o\(dq\& is replaced with he
start offset in mp3 frames\&. Double\-quotes and backslash\-espacing 
can be used to include white\-space to individual parameters\&.
By default, \fImpg123\fP is launched\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-mp3\-output"
Command for starting mp3 output\&. Ecasound will write stereo, 
signed, 16bit, little\-endian samples to standard output\&. Sample
rate is configurable\&. Before execution, %f is replaced with 
path to the output mp3, %S with sample rate in kHz, and 
%B with encoding bitrate in kbps\&. Double\-quotes and 
backslash\-espacing can be used to include white\-space to 
individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will try to
launch \fIlame\fP\&. As a special exception (added to Ecasound
2\&.7\&.0), if the output program is \(dq\&lame\(dq\& and options 
include \(dq\&\-\-big\-endian\(dq\&, Ecasound will detect this and output
big\-endian samples\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-ogg\-input"
Command for starting Ogg Vorbis input\&. Ecasound expects that audio samples
are written to standard output\&. It should be noted that
Ecasound is not able to query the audio format parameters from
ogg files, so these need to be set manually by the user\&.
Before execution, %f is replaced with path to the input ogg\&. 
Double\-quotes and backslash\-espacing can be used to include white\-space 
to individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will try to
launch (ogg123)\&.

be used to include white\-space to individual parameters\&.
By default Ecasound will try to launch \fItimidity\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-flac\-input"
Command for starting FLAC input\&. Ecasound expects that audio samples
are written to standard output\&. It should be noted that
Ecasound is not able to query the audio format parameters from
FLAC files, so these need to be set manually by the user\&. 
Before execution, %f is replaced with path to the input FLAC
file\&. Double\-quotes and backslash\-espacing can be used to include

can be used to include white\-space to individual parameters\&. By default 
Ecasound will try to launch (flac)\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext\-cmd\-aac\-input"
Command for starting AAC input\&. Ecasound expects that signed,
16bit, stereo, big\-endian audio samplesare written to standard 
output\&. It should be noted that	Ecasound is not able to query
