.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
Ecatools are simple command line utils for audio file processing\&.
Each tool is designed to perform one specific operation\&. Most of 
the tools also support batch processing\&.
.PP 
\fBECACONVERT\fP
.PP 
A tool for converting a set of files to a common target format\&.
This target format is given as the first command line
argument, and its syntax is \fI\&.ext\fP\&.
.PP 
\fBECAFIXDC\fP
.PP 
A simple command\-line tool for fixing DC\-offset\&.
.PP 
\fBECALENGTH\fP
.PP 
See the separate ecalength(1) man page\&.
.PP 
\fBECAMONITOR\fP
.PP 
Ecamonitor is a util program that can be used 
to monitor an active ecasound session\&. Ecamonitor 
is able to show information about the current 
chainsetup such as list of inputs, outputs, 
current position, effects, the engine status 
and numerous other things\&.
.PP 
By default ecamonitor will try to connect 
to IP4 address \(dq\&localhost\(dq\&, to port \(dq\&2868\(dq\&\&. 
A different address can be specified when 
starting ecamonitor, for example 
\(dq\&ecamonitor foo\&.mynetwork\&.com\(dq\& or
\(dq\&ecamonitor foo\&.mynetwork\&.com:4500\(dq\&\&.
.PP 
To enable inbound connections, ecasound has to be 
started with the \fI\-\-daemon\fP option\&. Ecamonitor is 
implemented in Python using the NetECI API\&.
.PP 
\fBECANORMALIZE\fP
.PP 
Ecanormalize is a command\-line tool for normalizing audio
files to utilize the full available sample resolution\&. Ecanormalize
first finds out how much the input file can be amplified without 
clipping and if there is room for increase, a static gain will 
be applied to the file\&.
.PP 
\fBECAPLAY\fP
.PP 
Ecaplay is a command\-line tool for playing audio files\&. Ecaplay 
uses the libecasound engine and is thus able to handle all audio formats
supported by the library\&. 
.PP 
Files can be selected for playback either by specifying the 
filenames on the command\-line, or by using the playlist 
mechanism\&. In playlist mode, files can be added to the playlist
using the \fI\-q\fP option\&. The \fI\-p\fP option can then be used
to play all tracks on the playlist\&. Ecaplay will repeat the
playlist tracks until explicitly stopped (with double Ctrl\-C)\&.
Playlist can be flushed with \fI\-f\fP and its contents listed
with \fI\-l\fP option\&.
.PP 
If not otherwise specified, ecaplay will use the audio output device 
specified in \fI~/\&.ecasound/ecasoundrc\fP for playback\&. A different 
output device can be selected with \fIECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE\fP shell 
environment variable or with the \fI\-o:output_device\fP command\-line
option\&.
.PP 
Playback can be stopped at any time with Ctrl\-C\&. If multiple
files are played, first Ctrl\-C will stop the current file and move
on to play the next one\&. Issuing Ctrl\-C twice (within one second), 
will cause ecaplay to exit\&.
.PP 
.IP "\-d:debuglevel"
Set libecasound debug level\&. See ecasound(1)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-f"
Flush the playlist contents\&. See also 
options \fI\-l, \-p and \-q\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-h"
Print usage information and exit\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-k:number"
Skip \(cq\&number\(cq\& of files\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-l"
List the current playlist contents to stdout\&. See also 
options \fI\-f, \-p and \-q\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-o:output_device"
Use \(cq\&output_device\(cq\& instead of the default output device 
(as specified in \fI~/\&.ecasound/ecasoundrc\fP)\&. Syntax is same
as used by \(dq\&\-o\(dq\& ecasound option (see ecasound(1) man page)\&.
This option overrides the \fIECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE\fP environment
variable (more info below)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-p"
Play tracks in the playlist (in looped mode)\&. See also 
options \fI\-f, \-l and \-q\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-q"
Queue new tracks to the playlist\&. All filenames given on
the command\-line will be added to the the playlist\&. It is 
possible to queue new tracks while another instance of 
ecaplay is using the playlist\&. See also options \fI\-f, \-l 
and \-p\fP\&.
.IP 
\fBECASIGNALVIEW\fP
.PP 
Ecasignalview is meant for monitoring signal amplitude and peak 
statistics\&. It accepts the following options:
.PP 
.IP "input"
The first option not starting with a \(cq\&\-\(cq\& is interpreted 
as an input string\&. This can be a device or a filename\&. All formats
supported by libecasound are accepted\&. Defaults to \(cq\&/dev/dsp\(cq\&\&.
.IP 
.IP "output"
Similarly to input, second option not starting with a \(cq\&\-\(cq\&
is interpreted as output\&. Defaults to \(cq\&null\(cq\&\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-b:buffersize"
Buffersize in sample frames\&. Defaults to 128\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-c"
Enable cumulative mode\&. Counters are not reseted after refresh\&.
\fI*deprecated*\fP
.IP 
.IP "\-d"
Enable debug mode\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-f:format_string"
Specify default audio format\&. See ecasound(1) for details\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-r:rate_msec"
Specify screen refresh rate in milliseconds\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-I"
Use linear scale for showing audio sample amplitude\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-L"
Use logarithmic scale for showing audio sample amplitude\&.
.IP 
.IP "\-G, \-B, \-M*, \-r, \-z"
Ecasound options use to modify the engine behaviour, see 
ecasound(1) manpage for details\&.
.IP 
When ecasignalview is running, the following keyboard 
commands can be used to control the operation (requires 
system support for UNIX terminal interface control):
.PP 
.IP "spacebar"
Reset statistics (max\-peak, avg\-amplitude and clipped
samples count)\&.
.IP 
.IP "q or Q or Esc"
Quit ecasignalview\&.
.IP 
It is also possible to reset the max\-peak and clipped\-samples 
counters by sending a SIGHUP signal to the process (i\&.e\&.
from another console: \(dq\&killall \-v \-HUP ecasignalview\(dq\&)\&.
.PP 
More complete documentation for ecasignalview can be found 
from \(dq\&Ecasound User\(cq\&s Guide\(dq\& (see \(cq\&\(cq\&http://nosignal\&.fi/ecasound 
\-> Documentation\(cq\&\(cq\&)\&.

.PP 
\fIECASOUND\fP
Path to the ecasound executable\&. Used by many ecatools\&.
.PP 
\fIECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE\fP
Device ecaplay should use for audio output\&. Same syntax
as for ecaplay/ecasound \(dq\&\-o\(dq\& option\&.
.PP 
.SH "FILES"

.PP 
\fI~/\&.ecasound/ecasoundrc\fP
The default ecasound resource file\&. See ecasoundrc(5)
for details\&.
.PP
