\fBecalength\fP [\-ahtsfmbcr] FILE1 [FILE2] [FILEn]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
This is ecalength, a few lines of code pompously named so because they  
let one retrieve the length of an audio file from the command line  
using ecasound\(cq\&s engine\&.  
.PP 
Limitations:  
.IP ""
\- With files without header information (raw files), ecalength will only work 
correctly if the audio file is at a sampling rate of 44100 hz\&.
(Addressed with the \-a switch\&.)
.IP ""
\- It is not foolproof, feeding it with something other than an audio  
file WILL result in ugly things being spewed back\&.  
(A bit better)
.IP ""
\- A thousand more that I haven\(cq\&t thought of\&.
