Ecasound bug tracker at sourceforge.net
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ecasound bug tracker at sourceforge.net is also used to track
feature requests:

   - https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4605&atid=104605

This same tracker is used for both longstanding bugs, as well as
for keeping tracking of feature/improvement requests. It replaces 
the old Ecasound Development Item practise (items marked with 'edi-x' 
tags) that was used during years 2002-08.

Active development areas
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably the best way to follow active development is to
subscribe to the ecasound-list mailing list (see the "Mailing
lists" section in README).
